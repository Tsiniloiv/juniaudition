Audition Project for Júní.

Possible Improvements:
1. Stricter controls on the SWR hook. Eliminate unwanted requests.
2. Input validation. I'm hoping the "" in the URL does that, but I don't know for sure.
3. Clean up the logic flow for the searchResults component. (Honestly, it being a component probably makes it more trouble than it's worth, since I have to account for rerenders, prop changes, etc.. But it fits better in my brain this way.)
